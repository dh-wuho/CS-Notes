Suppose the underlying set of intervals is the set {[a1, b1],[a2, b2],...,[an, bn]}. Let T be any balanced search tree for the set of interval endpoints {a1, a2,...,an, b1,...,bn}. Each interval [ai, bi] of our set is now stored in a node that satisfies 1. the key of the node is contained in [ai, bi], and 2. the interval [ai, bi] is contained in the interval associated with the node. This node might not be unique; if during this descent the key of the current node occurs as endpoint of the interval, then some node below the current node will also satisfy both properties. For the interval tree structure, it makes no difference which node we choose. To implement it, we need two different types of nodes: the search-tree nodes augmented by the left and right list pointers, and the list nodes. // list node typedef struct ls_n_t { key_t key; struct ls_n_t *next; object_t *object; } list_node_t; // tree node typedef struct tr_n_t { key_t key; struct tr_n_t *left; struct tr_n_t *right; list_node_t *left_list; list_node_t *right_list; /* balancing information */ } tree_node_t; Theorem. The interval tree structure is a static data structure that can be built in time O(n log n) and needs space O(n). It lists all intervals containing a given query key in output-sensitive time O(log n + k) if there are k such intervals. Why not a dynamic structure? 1. Insertion of an interval at a node involves insertion into two ordered lists of endpoints. For each list (when established using a BST with a doubly linked list of leaves), O(k) time to list the first k elements and O(log n) time for insertion and deletion. Restructuring of the tree to make it balanced requires correction of associated lists at each affected node. Requires joining and separation of ordered lists: No known way to achieve this in sublinear time! So, Building a tree for a superset of all expected interval endpoints, if known, can be an option, and it still requires search trees for the left and right lists in each node!","title":"Interval tree"},{"location":"csc541/segment-tree/","text":"The primary task performed by a segment tree is the same as that done by an interval tree: keeping track of a set of n intervals, here assumed to be halfopen, and listing for a given query key all the intervals that contain that key in output-sensitive time O(log n + k) if the output consisted of k intervals. Assume a setX = {x1, . . . , xn} of key values and a search tree T for {\u2212\u221e} \u222a X. Any interval [xi, xj [ can be expressed in many ways as union of node intervals,4 so it can be represented by subsets of the tree nodes. Theorem. The canonical interval decomposition is a representation of the interval as union of disjoint node intervals. Any search path for a value in the interval will go through exactly one node that belongs to the canonical interval decomposition. The canonical interval decomposition is easy to construct. We start with the interval [xi, xj [ at the root: 1. Each time the node interval of the current node is entirely contained in [xi, xj [, we take that node into our representation and stop following that path down because all nodes below are redundant; 2. Each time the node interval of the current node partially overlaps [xi, xj [, we follow both paths down; 3. Each time the node interval of the current node is disjoint from [xi, xj [, we stop following that path down. Theorem. Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} be a set of key values and T a search tree for {\u2212\u221e} \u222a X. Then for any interval bounded by values from X, the canonical decomposition has size at most 2 height(T ) and can be constructed in time O (height(T )). If T is of height O(log n), the canonical interval decomposition has size O(log n) and can be found in time O(log n). Theorem. The segment tree structure is a static data structure that can be built in time O(n log n) and needs space O(n log n). It lists all intervals containing a given query key in output-sensitive time O(log n + k) if there are k such intervals. To implement the segment tree structure, we again need two types of nodes \u2013 the tree nodes and the interval lists attached to each tree node. typedef struct ls_n_t { /* interval [a,b[ */ key_t key_a, key_b; struct ls_n_t *next; object_t *object; } list_node_t; typedef struct tr_n_t { key_t key; struct tr_n_t *left; struct tr_n_t *right; list_node_t *interval_list; /* balancing information */ } tree_node_t; Interval containment queries: Nither the root nor any node on the left or right boundary path of the tree, can have any intervals of the canonical interval decomposition. Node intervals are unbounded, and we are representing only finite intervals. Nodes near the leaf level will have nonempty lists. Interval trees tended to store intervals in higher-up nodes. Segment tree is static structure. Problems in Making it Dynamic Allow insertion and deletion in each node. There are O(log n) fragments of the canonical decomposition for single insert or delete. efficient O(log n) - use a search tree only for the first fragment, and doubly linked list for the remaining fragments. allowing O(1) insertion and deletion of intervals. Rebalancing of the underlying tree by rotations causes changes in the lists attached to the tree nodes no efficient solution, better than for interval trees, since the sequence of the intervals attached to a tree node does not matter. allows a representation of the sets of intervals attached to the nodes, which makes segment trees truly dynamic.","title":"Segment tree"},{"location":"csc541/segment-tree/#problems-in-making-it-dynamic","text":"Allow insertion and deletion in each node.

Dynamic Measure Tree A fully dynamic structure to maintain the measure of a union of intervals is the measure tree defined by Gonnet, Munro, and Wood (1983). The construction of the measure tree begins with any balanced search tree on the endpoints of all intervals in the current set and \u2212\u221e. The associated intervals of a node are all those intervals in the current set that have at least one endpoint in the node interval; like the node interval, we do not store the associated intervals in the node, but just need them as concept. Each node n of the search tree contains three additional fields: { n->measure is the measure of the intersection of the node interval of n with the union of all its associated intervals. { n->rightmax is the maximum right endpoint of all intervals associated with n. { n->leftmin is the minimum left endpoint of all intervals associated with n.
