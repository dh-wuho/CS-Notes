## **Designing for Disasters**

### Disasters
- availability
- data loss

### How
- reliability
    primary and secondary isolated from failure
- availability
    fail over
    reconstruction

### Design
- Rapid recovery vs Minimum data loss
- Recovery
- Backup for reliability
- Remote Mirroring
    asynchronous
    batch
    write-preserving
    synchronous(low RTO)
